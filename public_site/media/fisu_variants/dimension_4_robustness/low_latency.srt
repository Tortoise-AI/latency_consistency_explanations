1
00:00:09,176 --> 00:00:12,004
This is the final of the women's 50 metre freestyle.

2
00:00:11,993 --> 00:00:17,398
On her 23rd birthday, Olivia Nel goes as one of the favourites for a medal in Lane

3
00:00:16,909 --> 00:00:20,865
5. She's flanked by two Americans, Julia Dennis, quickest qualifier,

4
00:00:20,746 --> 00:00:23,096
and Maxine Parker, one of the favourites for the gold.

5
00:00:26,776 --> 00:00:31,281
While Dennis qualified with a 24.55 for this final, positions 2-8 were separated

6
00:00:31,777 --> 00:00:33,852
by a quarter of a second in the semi-finals.

7
00:00:34,680 --> 00:00:37,492
As it is Dennis who's leading the way, a massive underwater from her,

8
00:00:37,969 --> 00:00:40,510
going nicely in Lane 1 is Ambler of Italy.

9
00:00:40,461 --> 00:00:43,908
Now it's a chance for the field to chase down the two who are in front.

10
00:00:44,068 --> 00:00:47,022
Nel is looking to come back here, but she's leaving it a little late.

11
00:00:47,022 --> 00:00:49,261
Scotto Di Carlo looks good for a medal at the moment.

12
00:00:49,261 --> 00:00:51,270
She's closing on Dennis, and Parker looks excellent.

13
00:00:51,604 --> 00:00:53,725
She claims the gold splendidly.

14
00:00:53,531 --> 00:00:57,659
Not quite so quick as the semi-final, but it's good enough for the gold medal.

15
00:00:58,443 --> 00:01:00,138
Olivia Nel is on the podium.

16
00:01:00,407 --> 00:01:03,914
She manages to get past the two Italians in the closing metres.

17
00:01:04,300 --> 00:01:09,983
Maxine Parker takes the win ahead of Dennis by four hundredths of a second.

18
00:01:11,387 --> 00:01:13,578
University of Virginia strikes again.

19
00:01:14,172 --> 00:01:14,966
It's Parker.

20
00:01:15,746 --> 00:01:17,631
She's finally got that individual gold.

21
00:01:20,064 --> 00:01:23,963
One-two for USA, both comfortably sub 25 seconds.

22
00:01:22,251 --> 00:01:26,661
Parker of Virginia wins gold ahead of Dennis.

23
00:01:25,631 --> 00:01:30,038
Now to Louisville, and Olivia Nel on her birthday has bronze.
