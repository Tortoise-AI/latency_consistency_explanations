1
00:00:07,278 --> 00:00:10,106
This is the final of the women's 50 metre freestyle.

2
00:00:11,206 --> 00:00:16,611
On her 23rd birthday, Olivia Nel goes as one of the favourites for a medal in Lane

3
00:00:17,234 --> 00:00:21,190
5. She's flanked by two Americans, Julia Dennis, quickest qualifier,

4
00:00:21,032 --> 00:00:23,382
and Maxine Parker, one of the favourites for the gold.

5
00:00:26,735 --> 00:00:31,240
While Dennis qualified with a 24.55 for this final, positions 2-8 were separated

6
00:00:31,295 --> 00:00:33,370
by a quarter of a second in the semi-finals.

7
00:00:33,681 --> 00:00:36,493
As it is Dennis who's leading the way, a massive underwater from her,

8
00:00:36,577 --> 00:00:39,118
going nicely in Lane 1 is Ambler of Italy.

9
00:00:38,862 --> 00:00:42,309
Now it's a chance for the field to chase down the two who are in front.

10
00:00:42,335 --> 00:00:45,289
Nel is looking to come back here, but she's leaving it a little late.

11
00:00:45,441 --> 00:00:47,680
Scotto Di Carlo looks good for a medal at the moment.

12
00:00:47,833 --> 00:00:49,842
She's closing on Dennis, and Parker looks excellent.

13
00:00:50,790 --> 00:00:52,911
She claims the gold splendidly.

14
00:00:53,331 --> 00:00:57,459
Not quite so quick as the semi-final, but it's good enough for the gold medal.

15
00:00:58,762 --> 00:01:00,457
Olivia Nel is on the podium.

16
00:01:01,221 --> 00:01:04,728
She manages to get past the two Italians in the closing metres.

17
00:01:05,131 --> 00:01:10,814
Maxine Parker takes the win ahead of Dennis by four hundredths of a second.

18
00:01:11,915 --> 00:01:14,106
University of Virginia strikes again.

19
00:01:14,519 --> 00:01:15,313
It's Parker.

20
00:01:16,093 --> 00:01:17,978
She's finally got that individual gold.

21
00:01:20,779 --> 00:01:24,678
One-two for USA, both comfortably sub 25 seconds.

22
00:01:24,809 --> 00:01:29,219
Parker of Virginia wins gold ahead of Dennis.

23
00:01:30,031 --> 00:01:34,438
Now to Louisville, and Olivia Nel on her birthday has bronze.
