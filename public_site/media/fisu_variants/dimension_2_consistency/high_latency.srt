1
00:00:05,832 --> 00:00:08,660
This is the final of the women's 50 metre freestyle.

2
00:00:08,928 --> 00:00:14,333
On her 23rd birthday, Olivia Nel goes as one of the favourites for a medal in Lane

3
00:00:14,124 --> 00:00:18,080
5. She's flanked by two Americans, Julia Dennis, quickest qualifier,

4
00:00:18,017 --> 00:00:20,367
and Maxine Parker, one of the favourites for the gold.

5
00:00:24,047 --> 00:00:28,552
While Dennis qualified with a 24.55 for this final, positions 2-8 were separated

6
00:00:28,469 --> 00:00:30,544
by a quarter of a second in the semi-finals.

7
00:00:30,405 --> 00:00:33,217
As it is Dennis who's leading the way, a massive underwater from her,

8
00:00:33,697 --> 00:00:36,238
going nicely in Lane 1 is Ambler of Italy.

9
00:00:37,647 --> 00:00:41,094
Now it's a chance for the field to chase down the two who are in front.

10
00:00:42,420 --> 00:00:45,374
Nel is looking to come back here, but she's leaving it a little late.

11
00:00:45,374 --> 00:00:47,613
Scotto Di Carlo looks good for a medal at the moment.

12
00:00:47,613 --> 00:00:49,622
She's closing on Dennis, and Parker looks excellent.

13
00:00:50,405 --> 00:00:52,526
She claims the gold splendidly.

14
00:00:52,782 --> 00:00:56,910
Not quite so quick as the semi-final, but it's good enough for the gold medal.

15
00:00:59,778 --> 00:01:01,473
Olivia Nel is on the podium.

16
00:01:04,235 --> 00:01:07,742
She manages to get past the two Italians in the closing metres.

17
00:01:08,971 --> 00:01:14,654
Maxine Parker takes the win ahead of Dennis by four hundredths of a second.

18
00:01:15,802 --> 00:01:17,993
University of Virginia strikes again.

19
00:01:18,434 --> 00:01:19,228
It's Parker.

20
00:01:20,008 --> 00:01:21,893
She's finally got that individual gold.

21
00:01:24,326 --> 00:01:28,225
One-two for USA, both comfortably sub 25 seconds.

22
00:01:26,513 --> 00:01:30,923
Parker of Virginia wins gold ahead of Dennis.

23
00:01:29,893 --> 00:01:34,300
Now to Louisville, and Olivia Nel on her birthday has bronze.
