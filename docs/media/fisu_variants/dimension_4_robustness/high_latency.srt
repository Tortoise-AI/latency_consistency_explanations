1
00:00:08,100 --> 00:00:10,928
This is the final of the women's 50 metre freestyle.

2
00:00:11,238 --> 00:00:16,643
On her 23rd birthday, Olivia Nel goes as one of the favourites for a medal in Lane

3
00:00:16,475 --> 00:00:20,431
5. She's flanked by two Americans, Julia Dennis, quickest qualifier,

4
00:00:20,376 --> 00:00:22,726
and Maxine Parker, one of the favourites for the gold.

5
00:00:26,406 --> 00:00:30,911
While Dennis qualified with a 24.55 for this final, positions 2-8 were separated

6
00:00:30,967 --> 00:00:33,042
by a quarter of a second in the semi-finals.

7
00:00:33,135 --> 00:00:35,947
As it is Dennis who's leading the way, a massive underwater from her,

8
00:00:36,130 --> 00:00:38,671
going nicely in Lane 1 is Ambler of Italy.

9
00:00:38,988 --> 00:00:42,435
Now it's a chance for the field to chase down the two who are in front.

10
00:00:42,887 --> 00:00:45,841
Nel is looking to come back here, but she's leaving it a little late.

11
00:00:45,841 --> 00:00:48,080
Scotto Di Carlo looks good for a medal at the moment.

12
00:00:48,080 --> 00:00:50,089
She's closing on Dennis, and Parker looks excellent.

13
00:00:50,864 --> 00:00:52,985
She claims the gold splendidly.

14
00:00:53,233 --> 00:00:57,361
Not quite so quick as the semi-final, but it's good enough for the gold medal.

15
00:00:58,642 --> 00:01:00,337
Olivia Nel is on the podium.

16
00:01:01,118 --> 00:01:04,625
She manages to get past the two Italians in the closing metres.

17
00:01:05,206 --> 00:01:10,889
Maxine Parker takes the win ahead of Dennis by four hundredths of a second.

18
00:01:12,277 --> 00:01:14,468
University of Virginia strikes again.

19
00:01:15,053 --> 00:01:15,847
It's Parker.

20
00:01:16,627 --> 00:01:18,512
She's finally got that individual gold.

21
00:01:21,201 --> 00:01:25,100
One-two for USA, both comfortably sub 25 seconds.

22
00:01:24,669 --> 00:01:29,079
Parker of Virginia wins gold ahead of Dennis.

23
00:01:29,330 --> 00:01:33,737
Now to Louisville, and Olivia Nel on her birthday has bronze.
