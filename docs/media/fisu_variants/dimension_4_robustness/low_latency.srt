1
00:00:05,676 --> 00:00:08,504
This is the final of the women's 50 metre freestyle.

2
00:00:08,493 --> 00:00:13,898
On her 23rd birthday, Olivia Nel goes as one of the favourites for a medal in Lane

3
00:00:13,409 --> 00:00:17,365
5. She's flanked by two Americans, Julia Dennis, quickest qualifier,

4
00:00:17,246 --> 00:00:19,596
and Maxine Parker, one of the favourites for the gold.

5
00:00:23,276 --> 00:00:27,781
While Dennis qualified with a 24.55 for this final, positions 2-8 were separated

6
00:00:28,277 --> 00:00:30,352
by a quarter of a second in the semi-finals.

7
00:00:31,180 --> 00:00:33,992
As it is Dennis who's leading the way, a massive underwater from her,

8
00:00:34,469 --> 00:00:37,010
going nicely in Lane 1 is Ambler of Italy.

9
00:00:36,961 --> 00:00:40,408
Now it's a chance for the field to chase down the two who are in front.

10
00:00:40,568 --> 00:00:43,522
Nel is looking to come back here, but she's leaving it a little late.

11
00:00:43,522 --> 00:00:45,761
Scotto Di Carlo looks good for a medal at the moment.

12
00:00:45,761 --> 00:00:47,770
She's closing on Dennis, and Parker looks excellent.

13
00:00:48,104 --> 00:00:50,225
She claims the gold splendidly.

14
00:00:50,031 --> 00:00:54,159
Not quite so quick as the semi-final, but it's good enough for the gold medal.

15
00:00:54,943 --> 00:00:56,638
Olivia Nel is on the podium.

16
00:00:56,907 --> 00:01:00,414
She manages to get past the two Italians in the closing metres.

17
00:01:00,800 --> 00:01:06,483
Maxine Parker takes the win ahead of Dennis by four hundredths of a second.

18
00:01:07,887 --> 00:01:10,078
University of Virginia strikes again.

19
00:01:10,672 --> 00:01:11,466
It's Parker.

20
00:01:12,246 --> 00:01:14,131
She's finally got that individual gold.

21
00:01:16,564 --> 00:01:20,463
One-two for USA, both comfortably sub 25 seconds.

22
00:01:18,751 --> 00:01:23,161
Parker of Virginia wins gold ahead of Dennis.

23
00:01:22,131 --> 00:01:26,538
Now to Louisville, and Olivia Nel on her birthday has bronze.
