1
00:00:07,097 --> 00:00:09,925
This is the final of the women's 50 metre freestyle.

2
00:00:10,898 --> 00:00:16,303
On her 23rd birthday, Olivia Nel goes as one of the favourites for a medal in Lane

3
00:00:16,799 --> 00:00:20,755
5. She's flanked by two Americans, Julia Dennis, quickest qualifier,

4
00:00:20,833 --> 00:00:23,183
and Maxine Parker, one of the favourites for the gold.

5
00:00:26,863 --> 00:00:31,368
While Dennis qualified with a 24.55 for this final, positions 2-8 were separated

6
00:00:31,481 --> 00:00:33,556
by a quarter of a second in the semi-finals.

7
00:00:33,745 --> 00:00:36,557
As it is Dennis who's leading the way, a massive underwater from her,

8
00:00:36,651 --> 00:00:39,192
going nicely in Lane 1 is Ambler of Italy.

9
00:00:39,143 --> 00:00:42,590
Now it's a chance for the field to chase down the two who are in front.

10
00:00:42,750 --> 00:00:45,704
Nel is looking to come back here, but she's leaving it a little late.

11
00:00:45,704 --> 00:00:47,943
Scotto Di Carlo looks good for a medal at the moment.

12
00:00:47,943 --> 00:00:49,952
She's closing on Dennis, and Parker looks excellent.

13
00:00:50,735 --> 00:00:52,856
She claims the gold splendidly.

14
00:00:53,112 --> 00:00:57,240
Not quite so quick as the semi-final, but it's good enough for the gold medal.

15
00:00:58,668 --> 00:01:00,363
Olivia Nel is on the podium.

16
00:01:01,324 --> 00:01:04,831
She manages to get past the two Italians in the closing metres.

17
00:01:05,340 --> 00:01:11,023
Maxine Parker takes the win ahead of Dennis by four hundredths of a second.

18
00:01:12,171 --> 00:01:14,362
University of Virginia strikes again.

19
00:01:14,803 --> 00:01:15,597
It's Parker.

20
00:01:16,377 --> 00:01:18,262
She's finally got that individual gold.

21
00:01:20,977 --> 00:01:24,876
One-two for USA, both comfortably sub 25 seconds.

22
00:01:24,576 --> 00:01:28,986
Parker of Virginia wins gold ahead of Dennis.

23
00:01:29,367 --> 00:01:33,774
Now to Louisville, and Olivia Nel on her birthday has bronze.
