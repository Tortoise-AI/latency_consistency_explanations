00:00:02,796 --> 00:00:08,201
On her 23rd birthday, Olivia Nel goes as one of the favourites for a medal in Lane

3
00:00:09,183 --> 00:00:13,139
5. She's flanked by two Americans, Julia Dennis, quickest qualifier,

4
00:00:13,376 --> 00:00:15,726
and Maxine Parker, one of the favourites for the gold.

5
00:00:19,482 --> 00:00:23,987
While Dennis qualified with a 24.55 for this final, positions 2-8 were separated

6
00:00:24,210 --> 00:00:26,285
by a quarter of a second in the semi-finals.

7
00:00:26,607 --> 00:00:29,419
As it is Dennis who's leading the way, a massive underwater from her,

8
00:00:31,531 --> 00:00:34,072
going nicely in Lane 1 is Ambler of Italy.

9
00:00:38,868 --> 00:00:42,315
Now it's a chance for the field to chase down the two who are in front.

10
00:00:45,987 --> 00:00:48,941
Nel is looking to come back here, but she's leaving it a little late.

11
00:00:47,123 --> 00:00:49,362
Scotto Di Carlo looks good for a medal at the moment.

12
00:00:47,544 --> 00:00:49,553
She's closing on Dennis, and Parker looks excellent.

13
00:00:50,336 --> 00:00:52,457
She claims the gold splendidly.

14
00:00:52,713 --> 00:00:56,841
Not quite so quick as the semi-final, but it's good enough for the gold medal.

15
00:00:57,715 --> 00:00:59,410
Olivia Nel is on the podium.

16
00:00:59,679 --> 00:01:03,186
She manages to get past the two Italians in the closing metres.

17
00:01:03,419 --> 00:01:09,102
Maxine Parker takes the win ahead of Dennis by four hundredths of a second.

18
00:01:10,250 --> 00:01:12,441
University of Virginia strikes again.

19
00:01:12,882 --> 00:01:13,676
It's Parker.

20
00:01:14,456 --> 00:01:16,341
She's finally got that individual gold.

21
00:01:18,774 --> 00:01:22,673
One-two for USA, both comfortably sub 25 seconds.

22
00:01:20,961 --> 00:01:25,371
Parker of Virginia wins gold ahead of Dennis.

00:01:24,341 --> 00:01:28,748
