1
00:00:01,992 --> 00:00:04,820
This is the final of the women's 50 metre freestyle.

2
00:00:05,403 --> 00:00:10,808
On her 23rd birthday, Olivia Nel goes as one of the favourites for a medal in Lane

3
00:00:10,913 --> 00:00:14,869
5. She's flanked by two Americans, Julia Dennis, quickest qualifier,

4
00:00:14,869 --> 00:00:17,219
and Maxine Parker, one of the favourites for the gold.

5
00:00:20,899 --> 00:00:25,404
While Dennis qualified with a 24.55 for this final, positions 2-8 were separated

6
00:00:25,404 --> 00:00:27,479
by a quarter of a second in the semi-finals.

7
00:00:27,479 --> 00:00:30,291
As it is Dennis who's leading the way, a massive underwater from her,

8
00:00:30,291 --> 00:00:32,832
going nicely in Lane 1 is Ambler of Italy.

9
00:00:32,832 --> 00:00:36,279
Now it's a chance for the field to chase down the two who are in front.

10
00:00:36,478 --> 00:00:39,432
Nel is looking to come back here, but she's leaving it a little late.

11
00:00:39,432 --> 00:00:41,671
Scotto Di Carlo looks good for a medal at the moment.

12
00:00:41,671 --> 00:00:43,680
She's closing on Dennis, and Parker looks excellent.

13
00:00:44,759 --> 00:00:46,880
She claims the gold splendidly.

14
00:00:47,432 --> 00:00:51,560
Not quite so quick as the semi-final, but it's good enough for the gold medal.

15
00:00:52,784 --> 00:00:54,479
Olivia Nel is on the podium.

16
00:00:55,112 --> 00:00:58,619
She manages to get past the two Italians in the closing metres.

17
00:00:58,997 --> 00:01:04,680
Maxine Parker takes the win ahead of Dennis by four hundredths of a second.

18
00:01:05,828 --> 00:01:08,019
University of Virginia strikes again.

19
00:01:08,460 --> 00:01:09,254
It's Parker.

20
00:01:10,034 --> 00:01:11,919
She's finally got that individual gold.

21
00:01:14,720 --> 00:01:18,619
One-two for USA, both comfortably sub 25 seconds.

22
00:01:18,750 --> 00:01:23,160
Parker of Virginia wins gold ahead of Dennis.

23
00:01:23,972 --> 00:01:28,379
Now to Louisville, and Olivia Nel on her birthday has bronze.
