1
00:00:02,878 --> 00:00:05,706
This is the final of the women's 50 metre freestyle.

2
00:00:06,054 --> 00:00:11,459
On her 23rd birthday, Olivia Nel goes as one of the favourites for a medal in Lane

3
00:00:11,329 --> 00:00:15,285
5. She's flanked by two Americans, Julia Dennis, quickest qualifier,

4
00:00:15,238 --> 00:00:17,588
and Maxine Parker, one of the favourites for the gold.

5
00:00:21,268 --> 00:00:25,773
While Dennis qualified with a 24.55 for this final, positions 2-8 were separated

6
00:00:25,711 --> 00:00:27,786
by a quarter of a second in the semi-finals.

7
00:00:27,682 --> 00:00:30,494
As it is Dennis who's leading the way, a massive underwater from her,

8
00:00:30,853 --> 00:00:33,394
going nicely in Lane 1 is Ambler of Italy.

9
00:00:34,447 --> 00:00:37,894
Now it's a chance for the field to chase down the two who are in front.

10
00:00:38,935 --> 00:00:41,889
Nel is looking to come back here, but she's leaving it a little late.

11
00:00:41,889 --> 00:00:44,128
Scotto Di Carlo looks good for a medal at the moment.

12
00:00:44,128 --> 00:00:46,137
She's closing on Dennis, and Parker looks excellent.

13
00:00:46,995 --> 00:00:49,116
She claims the gold splendidly.

14
00:00:49,446 --> 00:00:53,574
Not quite so quick as the semi-final, but it's good enough for the gold medal.

15
00:00:56,027 --> 00:00:57,722
Olivia Nel is on the podium.

16
00:00:59,946 --> 00:01:03,453
She manages to get past the two Italians in the closing metres.

17
00:01:04,467 --> 00:01:10,150
Maxine Parker takes the win ahead of Dennis by four hundredths of a second.

18
00:01:11,298 --> 00:01:13,489
University of Virginia strikes again.

19
00:01:13,930 --> 00:01:14,724
It's Parker.

20
00:01:15,504 --> 00:01:17,389
She's finally got that individual gold.

21
00:01:19,915 --> 00:01:23,814
One-two for USA, both comfortably sub 25 seconds.

22
00:01:22,568 --> 00:01:26,978
Parker of Virginia wins gold ahead of Dennis.

23
00:01:26,413 --> 00:01:30,820
Now to Louisville, and Olivia Nel on her birthday has bronze.
