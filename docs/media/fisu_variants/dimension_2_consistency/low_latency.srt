1
00:00:07,915 --> 00:00:10,743
This is the final of the women's 50 metre freestyle.

2
00:00:11,239 --> 00:00:16,644
On her 23rd birthday, Olivia Nel goes as one of the favourites for a medal in Lane

3
00:00:16,662 --> 00:00:20,618
5. She's flanked by two Americans, Julia Dennis, quickest qualifier,

4
00:00:20,687 --> 00:00:23,037
and Maxine Parker, one of the favourites for the gold.

5
00:00:26,824 --> 00:00:31,329
While Dennis qualified with a 24.55 for this final, positions 2-8 were separated

6
00:00:31,444 --> 00:00:33,519
by a quarter of a second in the semi-finals.

7
00:00:33,638 --> 00:00:36,450
As it is Dennis who's leading the way, a massive underwater from her,

8
00:00:36,503 --> 00:00:39,044
going nicely in Lane 1 is Ambler of Italy.

9
00:00:38,995 --> 00:00:42,442
Now it's a chance for the field to chase down the two who are in front.

10
00:00:42,602 --> 00:00:45,556
Nel is looking to come back here, but she's leaving it a little late.

11
00:00:45,556 --> 00:00:47,795
Scotto Di Carlo looks good for a medal at the moment.

12
00:00:47,795 --> 00:00:49,804
She's closing on Dennis, and Parker looks excellent.

13
00:00:50,939 --> 00:00:53,060
She claims the gold splendidly.

14
00:00:53,669 --> 00:00:57,797
Not quite so quick as the semi-final, but it's good enough for the gold medal.

15
00:00:58,943 --> 00:01:00,638
Olivia Nel is on the podium.

16
00:01:01,160 --> 00:01:04,667
She manages to get past the two Italians in the closing metres.

17
00:01:05,001 --> 00:01:10,684
Maxine Parker takes the win ahead of Dennis by four hundredths of a second.

18
00:01:11,832 --> 00:01:14,023
University of Virginia strikes again.

19
00:01:14,464 --> 00:01:15,258
It's Parker.

20
00:01:16,038 --> 00:01:17,923
She's finally got that individual gold.

21
00:01:20,690 --> 00:01:24,589
One-two for USA, both comfortably sub 25 seconds.

22
00:01:24,553 --> 00:01:28,963
Parker of Virginia wins gold ahead of Dennis.

23
00:01:29,607 --> 00:01:34,014
Now to Louisville, and Olivia Nel on her birthday has bronze.
