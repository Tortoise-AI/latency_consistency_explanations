00:00:04,415 --> 00:00:07,243
This is the final of the women's 50 metre freestyle.

2
00:00:07,739 --> 00:00:13,144
On her 23rd birthday, Olivia Nel goes as one of the favourites for a medal in Lane

3
00:00:13,162 --> 00:00:17,118
5. She's flanked by two Americans, Julia Dennis, quickest qualifier,

4
00:00:17,187 --> 00:00:19,537
and Maxine Parker, one of the favourites for the gold.

5
00:00:23,324 --> 00:00:27,829
While Dennis qualified with a 24.55 for this final, positions 2-8 were separated

6
00:00:27,944 --> 00:00:30,019
by a quarter of a second in the semi-finals.

7
00:00:30,138 --> 00:00:32,950
As it is Dennis who's leading the way, a massive underwater from her,

8
00:00:33,003 --> 00:00:35,544
going nicely in Lane 1 is Ambler of Italy.

9
00:00:35,495 --> 00:00:38,942
Now it's a chance for the field to chase down the two who are in front.

10
00:00:39,102 --> 00:00:42,056
Nel is looking to come back here, but she's leaving it a little late.

11
00:00:42,056 --> 00:00:44,295
Scotto Di Carlo looks good for a medal at the moment.

12
00:00:44,295 --> 00:00:46,304
She's closing on Dennis, and Parker looks excellent.

13
00:00:47,439 --> 00:00:49,560
She claims the gold splendidly.

14
00:00:50,169 --> 00:00:54,297
Not quite so quick as the semi-final, but it's good enough for the gold medal.

15
00:00:55,443 --> 00:00:57,138
Olivia Nel is on the podium.

16
00:00:57,660 --> 00:01:01,167
She manages to get past the two Italians in the closing metres.

17
00:01:01,501 --> 00:01:07,184
Maxine Parker takes the win ahead of Dennis by four hundredths of a second.

18
00:01:08,332 --> 00:01:10,523
University of Virginia strikes again.

19
00:01:10,964 --> 00:01:11,758
It's Parker.

20
00:01:12,538 --> 00:01:14,423
She's finally got that individual gold.

21
00:01:17,190 --> 00:01:21,089
One-two for USA, both comfortably sub 25 seconds.

22
00:01:21,053 --> 00:01:25,463
Parker of Virginia wins gold ahead of Dennis.

23
00:01:26,107 --> 00:01:30,514
Now to Louisville, and Olivia Nel on her birthday has bronze.
