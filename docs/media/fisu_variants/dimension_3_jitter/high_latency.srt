1
00:00:03,778 --> 00:00:06,606
This is the final of the women's 50 metre freestyle.

2
00:00:07,706 --> 00:00:13,111
On her 23rd birthday, Olivia Nel goes as one of the favourites for a medal in Lane

3
00:00:13,734 --> 00:00:17,690
5. She's flanked by two Americans, Julia Dennis, quickest qualifier,

4
00:00:17,532 --> 00:00:19,882
and Maxine Parker, one of the favourites for the gold.

5
00:00:23,235 --> 00:00:27,740
While Dennis qualified with a 24.55 for this final, positions 2-8 were separated

6
00:00:27,795 --> 00:00:29,870
by a quarter of a second in the semi-finals.

7
00:00:30,181 --> 00:00:32,993
As it is Dennis who's leading the way, a massive underwater from her,

8
00:00:33,077 --> 00:00:35,618
going nicely in Lane 1 is Ambler of Italy.

9
00:00:35,362 --> 00:00:38,809
Now it's a chance for the field to chase down the two who are in front.

10
00:00:38,835 --> 00:00:41,789
Nel is looking to come back here, but she's leaving it a little late.

11
00:00:41,941 --> 00:00:44,180
Scotto Di Carlo looks good for a medal at the moment.

12
00:00:44,333 --> 00:00:46,342
She's closing on Dennis, and Parker looks excellent.

13
00:00:47,290 --> 00:00:49,411
She claims the gold splendidly.

14
00:00:49,831 --> 00:00:53,959
Not quite so quick as the semi-final, but it's good enough for the gold medal.

15
00:00:55,262 --> 00:00:56,957
Olivia Nel is on the podium.

16
00:00:57,721 --> 00:01:01,228
She manages to get past the two Italians in the closing metres.

17
00:01:01,631 --> 00:01:07,314
Maxine Parker takes the win ahead of Dennis by four hundredths of a second.

18
00:01:08,415 --> 00:01:10,606
University of Virginia strikes again.

19
00:01:11,019 --> 00:01:11,813
It's Parker.

20
00:01:12,593 --> 00:01:14,478
She's finally got that individual gold.

21
00:01:17,279 --> 00:01:21,178
One-two for USA, both comfortably sub 25 seconds.

22
00:01:21,309 --> 00:01:25,719
Parker of Virginia wins gold ahead of Dennis.

23
00:01:26,531 --> 00:01:30,938
Now to Louisville, and Olivia Nel on her birthday has bronze.
