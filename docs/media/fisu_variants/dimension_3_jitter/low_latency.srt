00:00:03,778 --> 00:00:06,606
This is the final of the women's 50 metre freestyle.

2
00:00:07,379 --> 00:00:12,784
On her 23rd birthday, Olivia Nel goes as one of the favourites for a medal in Lane

3
00:00:13,080 --> 00:00:17,036
5. She's flanked by two Americans, Julia Dennis, quickest qualifier,

4
00:00:17,118 --> 00:00:19,468
and Maxine Parker, one of the favourites for the gold.

5
00:00:23,203 --> 00:00:27,708
While Dennis qualified with a 24.55 for this final, positions 2-8 were separated

6
00:00:27,743 --> 00:00:29,818
by a quarter of a second in the semi-finals.

7
00:00:29,839 --> 00:00:32,651
As it is Dennis who's leading the way, a massive underwater from her,

8
00:00:32,698 --> 00:00:35,239
going nicely in Lane 1 is Ambler of Italy.

9
00:00:35,323 --> 00:00:38,770
Now it's a chance for the field to chase down the two who are in front.

10
00:00:39,037 --> 00:00:41,991
Nel is looking to come back here, but she's leaving it a little late.

11
00:00:41,991 --> 00:00:44,230
Scotto Di Carlo looks good for a medal at the moment.

12
00:00:44,230 --> 00:00:46,239
She's closing on Dennis, and Parker looks excellent.

13
00:00:47,318 --> 00:00:49,439
She claims the gold splendidly.

14
00:00:49,991 --> 00:00:54,119
Not quite so quick as the semi-final, but it's good enough for the gold medal.

15
00:00:55,380 --> 00:00:57,075
Olivia Nel is on the podium.

16
00:00:57,755 --> 00:01:01,262
She manages to get past the two Italians in the closing metres.

17
00:01:01,659 --> 00:01:07,342
Maxine Parker takes the win ahead of Dennis by four hundredths of a second.

18
00:01:08,490 --> 00:01:10,681
University of Virginia strikes again.

19
00:01:11,163 --> 00:01:11,957
It's Parker.

20
00:01:12,840 --> 00:01:14,725
She's finally got that individual gold.

21
00:01:17,611 --> 00:01:21,510
One-two for USA, both comfortably sub 25 seconds.

22
00:01:21,658 --> 00:01:26,068
Parker of Virginia wins gold ahead of Dennis.

23
00:01:26,896 --> 00:01:31,303
Now to Louisville, and Olivia Nel on her birthday has bronze.
